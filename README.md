Welcome to The Present Moment!  Reflect, ponder, and share your postive affirmations to focus on the things that matter most to you.

With all the challenges occuring throughout the globe, now more than ever do we need a routine to prime our minds to focus on things that will serve us, not stunt our growth.

Use the present moment to create a daily routine around randomised postive affirmation and spend a couple of minutes getting into a focused state about how the affirmation applies to your own life.

Here's how to ensure a proper set-up for the backend:

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

# Use Rack CORS for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), making cross-origin AJAX possible
gem 'rack-cors'

And then execute:
$ bundle

Or install it yourself as:
$ gem install rack-cors


* Ruby version
Ruby 2.6.1

* Deployment instructions

1. Make sure you have properly installed the Rack-Cors gem
2. 'cd' to the "daily_focus" directory
3. run rails db:migrate
4. run rails db:seed

And you should be all set!
